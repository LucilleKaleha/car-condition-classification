I recently facilitated a workshop run and organized by Moringa School. 
The workshop aimed to walk data enthusiasts and beginners in the industry through mastering Machine Learning with Python.

The project data was sourced from : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation

More details on the project available in the uploaded notebook.
